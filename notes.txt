    -> What is Java ?
        
        -> Java is a high-level, general-purpose, 
            memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. 

        -> high-level programming language

            -> human readable (abc print system)

        -> low-level programming language

            -> machine readable (010101001) 

            -> 01101010 01100001 01110110 01100001 ==> java 

            -> On Hardware level (embedded systems)
        
        -> general-purpose programming language

                i.e working with database systems 


        -> memory-safe programming language

            -> Memory : RAM (Non-Persistent Storage => Temporary Storage => FAST)
            -> Storage : HDD / SSD (Persistent Storage => Permanent Storage => SLOW)

                -> Garbage Collection 

                    -> int studentID = 101;
                    -> String studentName = "Ravi";

                    System.out.println("Welcome "+studentName);

                -> NOTE : As studentID is not being used, java will automatically
                    remove it from memory
        
        -> object-oriented programming language

            -> Object : Object is a real world entity 

            -> Representing real world entities in the programming world 

        -> Programming Paradigms 

            -> A programming paradigm is a relatively high-level way to conceptualize 
                and structure the implementation of a computer program.

            -> i taking class now today to 8 AM now (incorrect)

            -> i'm taking class today at 8 AM (correct)

    -> Rules 

        -> Write java code in a file with .java as extension

            -> print(good morning)

        -> Compilation 

            -> Convert Human Readable Code To Byte Code and Verify Syntax 

            -> we use a program called "javac" java compiler 

            -> syntax 

                javac Filename with extension 
                javac Demo.java 
                error: class, interface, enum, or record expected

        -> one of the rules in java is we need to start writing code 
        with class, interface, enum 

        -> Every java file we write must have a "class" at least
            class is a keyword here 

                class Demo {
                    print(good morning)
                }

            -> error: invalid method declaration; return type required 

        -> one of the rules is main method is starting point of program in java 

            -> method is a block of code that does some task 

            -> main method syntax 

                public static void main(String [] args) {

                }


                class Demo {

                        print(hello)            
                    }
                }

            -> error: ';' expected (; indicates end of statement)

        -> one of the rules is, text data should be enclosed in " "

            class Demo {
                public static void main(String [] args) {
                    print("hello");            
                }
            }

        -> error: cannot find symbol print 

        -> one of the rules is, if you want to print in java use below syntax 

            System.out.println("text");

        -> NOTE : After Successful Compilation, we get byte code in .class file 

            -> javac ==> Demo.java ==> Demo.class 

        -> NOTE : Execution is running byte code using "java" command 

            -> java ClassName 
            -> java Demo
 
        -> Start with this base code 

            package one_basics;

=============    

    -> DataTypes 

        -> Data type defines, what kind of data a variable can hold 
    
    -> Classification Of Data Types 

        -> Primitive Data Types 

            -> Java has 8 Primitive DataTypes

            -> byte : stores integers from -127 to 127 [ Size : 1 Byte]
            -> short : stores integers from -32768 to 32767 [ Size : 2 Bytes]
            -> int : stores integers from -2^31 to 2^31 -1 [ Size : 4 Bytes]
            -> long : stores huge integers [ Size : 8 Bytes]
                -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

        -> Complex Data Types 

            -> Strings 
            -> Arrays 
            -> Custom Classes you create 

    -> Type Conversion & Type Casting 

        -> Type conversion and casting in Java refer to the process of transforming/converting 
            a  value from one data type to another data type.

        -> Type Conversion (Implicit/Widening)

            -> This occurs automatically when a smaller data type is assigned to a larger data type, 
                without any explicit instruction from the programmer.
            
            -> It is considered safe as there is no risk of data loss.

        -> Type Casting (Explicit/Narrowing)

            -> This requires explicit instruction from the programmer to 
                convert a larger data type to a smaller data type.
            
            -> It is used when there is a potential for data loss, 
                as the smaller data type might not be able to hold the entire value of the larger one.
            
            -> Syntax 
            
                (targetDataType) valueOrVariable

            -> Assignment Operator is = 
            -> Combing Assignment Operator with Arithmetic Operators 
            -> Used to short hand / concise code 

            -> x = 10
            -> x = x + 5 or x += 5
            -> x = x * 5 or x *= 5 
        
        -> Increment / Decrement Operator 

            -> Increment increase value  ++
            -> Decrement decrease value  --

=============

    -> Comparison Operators (Relational)

        -> Used to Comparing values, results in boolean value i.e true/false 

        -> == (equality check)
        -> != (not equal check)
        -> > 
        -> <
        -> >= 
        -> <= 

    -> Logical Operators 

        -> Used to combine multiple condition checks, results in boolean value i.e true/false 

        -> && (and) : returns true, only when both conditions are true, otherwise false
        -> || (or) : returns true, when one of the conditions is true, when both are false then only its false
        -> ! (not) : negates the result, if true then false, if false then true

                X       Y         X && Y    X || Y    ! X    ! Y

            1 0 - 0
            0 1 - 0
            0 0 - 0

        -> | : when either one of the bit is 1, then result is 1

            1 1 - 1
            1 0 - 1
            0 1 - 1
            0 0 - 0

        -> etc 


    -> Control Structures / Statements

        -> Control statements in Java are fundamental constructs that manage 
        the "flow of program execution". 
        
        -> They allow for decision-making, repetitive tasks, and altering the 
        normal sequential execution of statements. 
        
        -> Control statements are categorized into three main types

            -> Conditional Statements (Decision Making Statements)

            -> Looping Statements (Iteration Statements)

            -> Branching Statements (Jump Statements)

        -> Conditional Statements (Decision Making Statements)

            -> if statement: Executes a "block of code" only if a 
                specified condition evaluates to true.

                -> syntax

                    if (condition) {
                        // code to be executed if condition is true
                    }

            -> if-else statement: Executes one block of code if the condition is true, 
                and a different block if the condition is false. 

                -> syntax

                    if (condition) {
                        // code to be executed if condition is true
                    } else {
                        // code if condition is false
                    }
            
            -> The ternary operator in Java, also known as the conditional operator, 
            is a shorthand way to write simple if-else statements, particularly when assigning 
            a value based on a condition.

                -> syntax

                    result = (condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false;

=============

    -> if-else-if ladder : is a control flow statement used to evaluate 
        multiple conditions. It provides a way to handle scenarios where 
        there are several possible courses of action based on different conditions.

        -> syntax
            
            if (condition1) {
                // Code to execute if condition1 is true
            } else if (condition2) {
                // Code to execute if condition2 is true
            } else if (condition3) {
                // Code to execute if condition3 is true
            } else {
                // Code to execute if none of the above conditions are true (optional)
            } 

    
    -> switch: statement in Java provides a way to control program flow by 
        executing different blocks of code based on the value of a single variable 
        or expression.

        -> It offers an alternative to using a series of if-else if-else statements

        -> syntax

            switch (expression) {
            case value1:
                // code block to execute if expression matches value1
                break; // Exits the switch statement
            case value2:
                // code block to execute if expression matches value2
                break;
            // ... more case statements
            default:
                // code block to execute if no case matches the expression
                break; // Optional for the default case if it's the last block
            }


    -> Nested Conditionals 

        -> Conditionals inside Conditionals 

        -> Allows for evaluating multiple conditions sequentially, 
            where the inner condition is only checked if the outer condition is true.

        -> syntax

            if (outerCondition) {
                // Code to execute if outerCondition is true

                if (innerCondition) {
                    // Code to execute if both outerCondition AND innerCondition are true
                } else {
                    // Code to execute if outerCondition is true, but innerCondition is false
                }

            } else {
                // Code to execute if outerCondition is false
            }

    -> The Scanner class in Java, found within the "java.util" package, 
        is a utility for reading user input

        -> nextInt(): Reads the next token as an int.
        -> nextDouble(): Reads the next token as a double.
        -> next(): Reads the next token (a single word) as a String.
        -> nextLine(): Reads the entire line of input, including spaces, until a newline character is encountered, as a String. 
        -> etc

=============

    -> Looping Statements (Iteration Statements)

        -> Java offers several looping statements to repeatedly execute a block 
        of code based on a specified condition. 
        These loops are essential for tasks requiring repetitive actions and 
        help reduce code redundancy.

        -> Types Of Looping Statements

            -> for loop 

                -> The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known or fixed. 
                It consists of three parts within its parentheses: 
                    initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

                -> syntax

                    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                        // Code to be executed in each iteration
                        System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
                    }


            -> while loop

                -> The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as 
                    a given condition remains true. 
                
                -> The while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown. 

                -> syntax

                    int count = 0;
                    while (count < 3) {
                        // Code to be executed
                        System.out.println("Count: " + count);
                        count++;
                    }

            -> do-while loop 

                -> The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, 
                    but it guarantees that the loop body will execute at least once 
                    before checking the condition i.e first condition check is skipped 

                -> syntax

                    int i = 0;
                    do {
                        // Code to be executed at least once
                        System.out.println("Value of i: " + i);
                        i++;
                    } while (i < 2);

        -> Nested Loops 

            -> A nested loop in Java refers to a loop structure where one loop 
            is placed inside another loop. This means that for each iteration 
            of the outer loop, the entire inner loop completes its execution. 
            
            -> Nested loops are useful for iterating through multi-dimensional 
                data structures like arrays, array lists etc 

            -> syntax 

                for (initialization_outer; condition_outer; increment/decrement_outer) {
                // Outer loop body
                    for (initialization_inner; condition_inner; increment/decrement_inner) {
                        // Inner loop body
                    }
                }

=============

    -> Branching Statements (Jump Statements)

        -> Branching statements in Java are used to "alter" the "normal sequential 
            flow" of control within a program. 
            They allow the program to make decisions and jump to different parts 
            of the code based on certain conditions or requirements. 

        -> break 

            -> Used to immediately "terminate" the innermost switch statement or loop

        -> continue

            -> Used to "skip the current iteration" of a loop (for, while, do-while) 
                and proceed to the next iteration. 

        -> return

            -> Used to explicitly exit a method and return control to 
                the point where the method was called.

    -> Loops Task 

    -> OOPS - Object Oriented Programming 

    -> OOPS - We Structure Programs Using Real World Entities(Objects)

    -> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm(style)
    that organizes code around "objects", which are software entities that 
    contain both data (variables/attributes) and  behavior(functions/methods). 
    
    -> OOP promotes modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

    -> To Work with OOP Style, we need an understanding of 

        -> Objects 

        -> Classes 

        -> Methods 

        -> Instance Data 

        -> Class Data

            -> Object - Data        (variables/attributes)
            -> Object - Behavior    (methods/functions)

        -> Writing Code that follows Object Oriented Design 

            -> Focus in on Objects and their relationships, not just tasks 

        
    -> Object 

        -> In terms of real world, everything is an Object 

        -> An Object Has two entities 

            -> An Object has something like characteristics / properties 
                i.e (variables/attributes)

                -> CAR is an object 

                    -> CAR has something
                    -> CAR has brand
                    -> CAR has price
                    -> CAR has color 
                    -> CAR has etc 

            -> An Object does something like behaviors / actions 
                i.e (methods/functions)

                    -> CAR does something
                    -> CAR does drive forward
                    -> CAR does drive backward
                    -> CAR does sound horn 
                    -> CAR does blink indicators 
                    -> CAR does etc  
    
    -> But, how to create an Object ?

        -> We need "Class" 
    
    -> Class 

        -> A class is a blueprint of object

        -> A class will define what characteristics & behaviors, an object should possess 

    -> Object 

        -> An object is an actual/real instance of class 

    -> Laptop (class)

        -> Laptop can have a brand, price, weight and can do playing video, audio, snaps

        -> Dell Object 

            -> Laptop brand = dell 
            -> Laptop price = 65000 
            -> Laptop weight = 2.5 kgs 

            -> Dell laptop can play video (1080p)
            -> Dell laptop can play audio (10watt)
            -> Dell laptop can take snap (12 MP Camera)

        -> Apple Mac Object 

            -> Laptop brand = apple 
            -> Laptop price = 150000 
            -> Laptop weight = 1.2 kgs 

            -> Apple laptop can play video (4k)
            -> Apple laptop can play audio (30watt)
            -> Apple laptop can take snap (24 MP Camera)


    -> Methods 

        -> Behaviors / Actions an object can perform 

        -> A method is a block of code that performs a task 

    -> syntax 
            
            Creating Class
            ---------------

            class ClassName {

8th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Instance Variables 

        -> Variables which are declared inside a class but outside the methods
            and also not static 

        -> Instance Variables belong to each object of class 
        
        -> Memory is allocated when an object is created 

        -> If we don't assign values, java will assign default values 

    -> Local Variables 

        -> Variables which are declared inside a method, block, constructor 

        -> Only Accessible within declared areas like method, block, constructor 

        -> Local Variables must be initialized before use 

    -> Static Variables (Class Variables)

        -> Variables which are declared inside a class but outside the methods
            and also using static keyword 

        -> Static Variables belong to class, not individual objects 

        -> Only One Copy exists and is shared among all the objects 

        -> Accessed Using Class Name 

        -> NOTE: When you need common data for all objects use Static Variables

    -> Methods 

        -> Behaviors / Actions an object can perform 

        -> A method is a block of code that performs a task 

        -> Method Declaration

            public int methodName(parameters) --> Method Header
            
            {
                statement
                statement           --> Method Body 
                statement
            }

            -> case 1 

                public void welcomeMessage() {

                }

            -> case 2 

                public int mathCalculations(int num1, int num2) {
                    return value
                }

            -> case 3

                    return value
                }

11th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Constructors 

        -> Method : Block of code thats performs a task 

        -> Constructor : Block of code thats performs data initialization 

            -> Constructor is a special method that is automatically called, 
                when an object is created 

        -> Normal Methods (instance methods)

            -> create object 
            -> call method 

        -> Constructors are mainly used for 

            -> initialization of default values (custom data)

        -> NOTE

            -> Constructors name should always be class name only, unlike methods 

            -> Constructors will not have return type 

        -> Types Of Constructors

            -> Default Constructor / Implicit Constructor

                -> Used to set all objects with same default values 

            -> Parameterized Constructor / Explicit Constructor

                -> Used to set different objects with different values 

    -> "this" keyword 

        -> this keyword refers to current class object  

        -> we use this to avoid ambiguity, between variables and parameters 


13th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Constructor Overloading 

        -> Constructor overloading in Java allows a class to have 
        multiple constructors, each with the same name (the class name) 
        but a different parameter list. 
        
        -> This enables objects of the class to be initialized in various ways, 
            providing flexibility in object creation.

        -> Based On 

            -> Number Of parameters
            -> Types Of parameters
            -> Order Of parameters

        -> this(): constructor call for calling another constructor  

    
    -> So far we worked with data types that will hold one single value in a variable

    -> My next use case demands me to hold multiple values in a single variable ?

        -> In java we have Collections API (Framework), to handle 
            multiple values in a single variable

    -> To get started with Collections API, it's better to know about "Arrays" first 

    -> Arrays 

        -> Arrays in Java are fundamental data structures used to store a 
        fixed-size, sequential collection of elements of the same data type(Homogeneous). 
        They are objects in Java and can hold either primitive data types (like int, char, float) 
        or objects of a class i.e complex data types.

        -> To access data inside arrays 

            -> Indexed Access: Elements are accessed using a zero-based index, 
                meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, 
                and so on.

        -> syntax

            datatype[] variable_name = new datatype[size];

                int[] numbers = new int[5]; 
                // Declares an array named 'numbers' that can hold 5 integers.

        -> Array Types 

            -> Single Dimensional Arrays 

                datatype[] variable_name = new datatype[size];

            -> Multi Dimensional Arrays 

        -> We can work with arrays in the same way, as we worked with simple variables like

            -> We can perform operations using Operators

            -> We can perform checks using Conditionals 

            -> We can repeat iterations using Loops 


15th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Multi Dimensional Arrays 

        -> A multidimensional array in Java is essentially an "array of arrays."
         The most common type is a two-dimensional array, which can be 
         visualized as a "table" or a "grid" with rows and columns. 
         
        -> You can also create arrays with three or more dimensions, 
            though they are less common. 

        -> https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/5FHM7hJI0hPo_rJgx4R8a2CC8v2ISrrCnekWkU007oZbePGbL_aN60EzDxlhKtnt1Zh9traQP2DQJV4w-6cyIDB8hG3E3v7Y4JC2lGd5Y3YHVQ

        -> For Accessing Data in multidimensional array use below Approach

            -> https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240415190237/Representation-of-Matrix.webp

        -> syntax

            datatype[][] variable_name = new datatype[row_size][column_size];
        
            int[][] matrix = new int[3][4]; // A 3x4 matrix (3 rows, 4 columns)


18th Nov 2025
=============

    -> Strings 

        -> A String is collection or sequence of characters 

        -> Strings is a special data type in java 

            -> String is a non-primitive data type, but assigning data can be done like primitives 

            -> Strings are handled in different way compared to other classes 

            -> When working with other non-primitive data types, when we print object we get object address  

            -> But with strings though they are non-primitive data types, when we print object we get empty space

            -> String Memory Management 

                -> Strings have a concept called String Memory Pool, where same strings will be allocated with 
                    same memory address 

                -> This "interning" process ensures that multiple identical string literals point to the same 
                    memory location, preventing duplicate objects and saving memory. 

                -> https://journaldev.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/2012/11/String-Pool-Java1-450x249.png

                -> == with strings we compare objects 
                -> == with primitives data types like int, float etc we compare values  
                -> equals() with strings we compare values 


        -> String Methods 

            -> String class provides a rich set of methods to work with string data 

            -> String are one of the most widely used data type in any programming language

            -> Majority of inputs in web Applications will be strings 

        -> String Immutability 

            -> Strings are constant i.e they cannot be changed once created 

            -> Immutable means cannot be changed / modified 


20th Nov 2025
=============

    -> String Mutability 

    -> Say we have string, when we perform any operation on Strings say like concat(), then
        it results in creation of new string objects 

    -> This Approach leads to performance issues, when making lot of modifications on strings

    -> To overcome this, Java has provided following classes to handle Mutable Strings

        -> StringBuffer (Thread Safe)

        -> StringBuilder (Not Thread Safe)

    -> NOTE:

        -> Strings: Like Pen & Paper 

        -> StringBuffer & StringBuilder: Like White Board & Marker 

    
    -> Local variables 

    -> Static variables 

    -> Instance Variables 

    -> Static Methods 

    -> Static Blocks 

    -> Instance Methods 

    -> Instance Blocks 

    -> NOTE : How can we allocate memory to a java program ?

        -> If Memory is not allocated, we cannot run programs 

            -> Using "new" keyword  (Via Creating Object)

            -> Using "static" keyword (Without Object Creation)

    -> Assume Main is not static 

        -> To Start Program Execution 

        -> We need entry point i.e main method 

        -> Main is not static 

        -> Object needs to be created first 

        -> But to create the object, java needs to execute program (begins a main)

        -> Which again requires the object, this leads to Circular Dependency Problem 

    -> To overcome above Circular Dependency Problem, java came up with "static" keyword 

    -> Class Loader Subsystem 

        -> First will write .java file 
        -> We compile then we get .class file 
        -> The .class file is loaded into Class Loader Subsystem 
        -> Then class loader Subsystem, will look for static fields(variables, methods, blocks) are present
        if present then immediately in method area, a memory block will be allocated (only once memory allocated)
        -> Then class loader will look for Object Creation(new keyword), if present then 
        immediately in heap area, a memory block will be allocated (for every object memory is allocated)

    -> Static Methods vs Instance Methods 

        -> Static Methods

            -> Belong to the class, not an instance.
            -> Can be called directly using the class name (no need to create an object).
            -> Cannot directly access non-static variables or methods because they are tied to an instance.
            -> Declared using the static keyword.

        -> Instance Methods 

            -> Belong to the object (instance).
            -> Require an object to be called.
            -> Can access both static and non-static variables/methods.

    
    -> Static Blocks vs Instance Blocks 

        -> Static Blocks 

            -> Executed once when the class is loaded into memory
            -> Used for initializing static variables 
            -> Declared using static { ... }
                -> static { }

        -> Instance Blocks 

            -> Executed each time an object is created
            -> Used for initializing instance variables 
                -> We used constructors for same purpose, then why instance blocks ?
                    -> NOTE: Constructors internally use Instance Blocks 
            -> Declared using without static { ... }
                -> { }


    -> NOTE: Order Of Execution, When Object is not created 

        -> Static Blocks 
        -> Static Main Method 

    -> NOTE: Order Of Execution, When Object is created 

        -> Static Blocks 
        -> Static Main Method 
        -> Instance Block 
        -> Constructor 


25th Nov 2025
=============

    -> OOP Principals 

        -> Inheritance 

            -> Establishing relationship between Classes, so that we can achieve "REUSABILITY"

        -> Encapsulation

            -> Hiding Data 

            -> Encapsulation means binding Data & Behavior together, we use Class 

        -> Abstraction 

            -> Hiding Implementation (Internal Details)

            -> Show Only essential features required 

        -> Polymorphism

            -> An ability of a single entity, to exhibit Multiple Forms 


    -> Inheritance

        -> Inheritance is a core OOP concept where a new class, 
        called a subclass or child class, acquires the properties(vars) and methods 
        of an existing class, called a superclass or parent class.

        -> Main purpose of Inheritance is Code Reusability

        -> Class which inherits is called CHILD CLASS

        -> Class that passes traits is called PARENT CLASS

        -> Inheritance can be introduced using "extends" / "implements" keyword

        -> With Inheritance

            -> Code Reusability

            -> No Code Duplication 

            -> Project Size is less 

            -> Code Reliability improved 

            -> Code Maintainability improved

        -> Types Of Inheritance

            -> Single Level Inheritance

                -> One Parent -> One Child 

                -> A class inherits from Single Parent Class 

            -> Multi Level Inheritance 

                -> Grand Parent -> Parent -> Child 

                -> A class inherit from another class, which in turn inherits from another class 
            
            -> Multiple Inheritance 

                -> If a class inherits from more than one class / two or more classes
                    then it's called Multiple Inheritance

                -> Java doesn't support Multiple Inheritance using Classes 

                -> Java supports Multiple Inheritance using "Interfaces" 

                -> Interface : Interfaces have abstract methods (No Implementation For Methods)

                -> To achieve Multiple Inheritance we use "implements" keyword     

            -> Hierarchial Inheritance

                -> One Parent -> Multiple Child 

                -> Multiple Classes can Inherit from a Single Parent 

            -> Hybrid Inheritance

                -> Combination or two or more types

=============

    -> Applying Inheritance On LMS 

    -> In Future we might add Mentor, VideoAdmin, SuperAdmin 

    -> Keeping REUSABILITY in context, will add a Common Entity For all above 

        -> Person Class - Common Entity

    -> super keyword 

        -> allows you to access parent class attributes inside child class 

    
    -> Encapsulation

        -> Encapsulation is an object-oriented programming (OOP) concept that involves 
        bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data 
        into a single unit, called a class.

        -> Data Hiding 

            -> Access Modifiers 

                -> Public 

                -> Private 

                -> Protected 

                -> Default

            -> Above Applies for all entities in java like variables, methods etc 

            -> NOTE : Only On Top Level Classes we can use, only public and default 

            -> NOTE : On Inner Level Classes we can use all Access Modifiers
