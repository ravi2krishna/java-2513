            -> Core Java 

            -> Advance Java 

        -> Deployment Tools 

            -> Cloud & DevOps 

    -> Java is Backend Technology 

    -> Popular Applications and their Technology Stack 

        -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages_used_in_most_popular_websites

    
    -> What is Java ?
        
        -> Java is a high-level, general-purpose, 
            memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. 

        -> high-level programming language

            -> human readable (abc print system)

        -> low-level programming language

            -> machine readable (010101001) 

            -> 01101010 01100001 01110110 01100001 ==> java 

            -> On Hardware level (embedded systems)
        
        -> general-purpose programming language

            -> Used for various domains 

            -> Java can be used to build 

                -> Desktop Applications 

                -> Web Applications 

                -> Mobile Applications 

                -> etc 
        
        -> domain-specific programming language

            -> Used only for specific use case like SQL 

            -> Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used to manage data
                i.e working with database systems 


        -> memory-safe programming language

            -> Memory : RAM (Non-Persistent Storage => Temporary Storage => FAST)
            -> Storage : HDD / SSD (Persistent Storage => Permanent Storage => SLOW)

                -> Garbage Collection 

                    -> int studentID = 101;
                    -> String studentName = "Ravi";

                    System.out.println("Welcome "+studentName);

                -> NOTE : As studentID is not being used, java will automatically
                    remove it from memory
        
        -> object-oriented programming language

            -> Object : Object is a real world entity 

            -> Representing real world entities in the programming world 

        -> Programming Paradigms 

            -> A programming paradigm is a relatively high-level way to conceptualize 
                and structure the implementation of a computer program. 

            -> Imperative Approach 

                -> HOW TO DO (Java)

            -> Declarative Approach

                -> WHAT TO DO (SQL)

        -> Compiled Language(Java, C etc) vs Interpreted Languages (Python, Java)

            -> Source Code (Human Readable ) 
                -> Compilation (Convert Human Readable to intermediate form byte code)
                    -> Interpretation (byte code convert to machine/binary code)

            -> Compiled Languages are faster in performance 

            -> Java use cases 
                -> Banking 
                -> Finance 
                -> Large Scale Applications (Enterprise Level Applications)
                
                -> AI / ML / DL (not java, for python)

            -> IDE is for writing code 
                -> auto code completion
                -> syntax highlight 
                -> install add-ons / plugins / extensions 

            -> Our IDE : Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

                -> Eclipse
                -> Intellij 
                -> etc 
    
    -> Install Java 

        -> Verify if java is installed or not 
            -> open command prompt and run below command
            -> java --version 

        -> Download From : https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

            -> Install : JDK 25 is the latest Long-Term Support (LTS)
        
            -> After Installing close and re-open command prompt and run below command

                -> java --version
    
    -> Install IDE (Visual Studio Code - vs code)

            -> open start menu and search for vs code

        -> Download From : https://code.visualstudio.com/download

        -> After Installing open start menu and search for vs code

    -> English (Language)

        -> Start with Alphabets => Words => Sentences 

    -> Java (Programming Language)    

        -> Start with Keywords => Syntax => Programs (Applications)

    -> How To Write Java Code ? 

        -> Any programming language has Syntax (Rules & Guidelines)

        -> Comparing a programming language with english language

            -> i taking class now today to 8 AM now (incorrect)

            -> i'm taking class today at 8 AM (correct)

    -> Rules 

        -> Write java code in a file with .java as extension

            -> print(good morning)

        -> Compilation 

            -> Convert Human Readable Code To Byte Code and Verify Syntax 

            -> we use a program called "javac" java compiler 

            -> syntax 

                javac Filename with extension 
                javac Demo.java 
                error: class, interface, enum, or record expected

        -> one of the rules in java is we need to start writing code 
        with class, interface, enum 

        -> Every java file we write must have a "class" at least
            class is a keyword here 

                class Demo {
                    print(good morning)
                }

            -> error: invalid method declaration; return type required 

        -> one of the rules is main method is starting point of program in java 

            -> method is a block of code that does some task 

            -> main method syntax 

                public static void main(String [] args) {

                }


                class Demo {
                    public static void main(String [] args) {
                        print(hello)            
                    }
                }

            -> error: ';' expected (; indicates end of statement)

        -> one of the rules is, text data should be enclosed in " "

            class Demo {
                public static void main(String [] args) {
                    print("hello");            
                }
            }

        -> error: cannot find symbol print 

        -> one of the rules is, if you want to print in java use below syntax 

            System.out.println("text");

        -> NOTE : After Successful Compilation, we get byte code in .class file 

            -> javac ==> Demo.java ==> Demo.class 

        -> NOTE : Execution is running byte code using "java" command 

            -> java ClassName 
            -> java Demo
 
        -> Start with this base code 

            package one_basics;
            class Demo {
                public static void main(String [] args) {
                    System.out.println("hello");            
                }
            }

        -> javac ==> Demo.java ==> Demo.class ==> java Demo 

            -> javac one_basics/Demo.java
            -> java one_basics/Demo

=============

    -> JVM - JRE - JDK 

    -> JVM - Java Virtual Machine 

        -> Virtual Machine : A logical machine inside a physical machine 

        -> Executes Byte Code 

        -> java one_basics/Demo - invokes jvm to run byte code 

        -> JVM technically converts byte code to machine code 
    
    -> JRE - Java Runtime Environment

        -> Runtime Environment : Providing required infrastructure to run programs / apps 

        -> Providers & Consumers 

        -> Consumers need JRE to run java Applications

        -> NOTE : JRE includes JVM 

    -> JDK - Java Development Kit 

        -> Development Kit : Provides required tools to develop/build programs / apps 

        -> Used by Providers i.e Developers 

        -> NOTE : JDK includes JRE 

    
    -> Variables 

        -> A variable is a named storage location in memory(RAM) used to hold/store data

        -> Variables allows you to 

            -> Assign (Store Data)

            -> Retrieve Data 

            -> Manipulate Data (If required)

        -> In java we can ignore a piece of code using comments 
            represented using //

        -> Syntax Rules

            datatype variable_name = value;
        
        -> concatenation 

            -> In Java, string concatenation refers to the process of joining two or more strings
                Using the + operator

        -> Manipulate Data (If required), you need to know about "Operators"     

        -> Identifiers & Data Types Next
