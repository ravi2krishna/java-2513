# Task On Working With Operators (Don't Use Control Structures)

# Assume You are building an Student Management System 

# In this project, you simulate a simple system that stores and processes 
    a student’s academic and attendance details.

-> Take Input from Student and Store Data 

    -> ID 
    -> Name
    -> Age 
    -> Quiz Score (0-100)
    -> Assignment Score (0-100)
    -> Exam Score (0-100)
    -> Attendance (0-100)

    -> Calculate 

        -> Total Score 
        -> Average Score 

    -> Based On Average Score, say the student passed or not (pass means avb above 75)

    -> Increase Attendance By one point 

    -> Check If the Student Got An Award 

        -> Student Should Pass 
        -> Student requires above 75 attendance

    -> Display Output 

        -> Name 
        -> Total Score 
        -> Average Score 
        -> Student Passed status 
        -> Student Award status
