# Task On Working With Loops 

# In the Student Management System, implement Grade Tracker

-> Take Inputs 

    -> Student ID
    -> Student Name 
    -> Attendance 

-> Prompt the student to input score 

    -> Repeatedly ask student for marks (yes/no)

    -> Keep taking scores till the student says no 

        -> do you want to enter scores (yes/no) ?
            -> yes -> ask for score -> 90
        -> do you want to enter scores (yes/no) ?
            -> yes -> ask for score -> 85
        -> do you want to enter scores (yes/no) ?
            -> no -> then stop taking scores 
    
    -> Based on scores you got, calculate Total Marks 

    -> Based on scores you got, calculate Average Marks 

-> Based On Average Marks 

    -> 85 & Above = "A" Grade
    -> 75 to 84 = "B" Grade
    -> 74 to 60 = "C" Grade
    -> 59 to 35 = "D" Grade
    -> below 35 = "FAIL"


-> Attendance >= 75 and "A" grade Give him Award 

-> Output Details 

    -> Student Name 
    -> Total Score 
    -> Average Score
    -> Number Of Scores 
    -> Award Status
