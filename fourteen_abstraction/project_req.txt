# Build Learning Management System (LMS)

-> Goal of the project is to simulate "grading" and "payment" tracking within LMS

-> In LMS, currently we have 
    
    -> Student Entity 

    -> Trainer Entity 

    -> CHANGE
        
        -> Other Entities can be expected in future (Admin, Mentor etc)

        -> These Entities might have some common reusable attributes 

        -> Will Define common reusable attributes in a Parent class like Person 

        -> Student is a Person 
        -> Trainer is a Person 
        -> Admin is a Person 
        -> etc 


-> Idea here is to design a system using classes, objects, methods, variables etc 
    to better understand how to organize code w.r.t OOP Principals 
    to simulate a Real World Application

-> Student Entity 

    -> ID 
    -> Name 
    -> Attendance (0-100)
    -> Score (0-100)
    
    -> Collect Above Data From Student 

    -> New Change 

        -> Take input from students for multiple subjects(5) and based on 
        the average of the subjects, calculate Score Credits by 
        dynamically passing average score to Score Credits functionality

    -> Attendance Credits To be given based on number of sessions attended 

        -> 30 and above : 5 Credits
        -> 20-29 : 3 Credits
        -> Below 20 : 0 Credits

    -> Score Credits To be given based on Score 

        -> 85 and above : 5 Credits
        -> 60-84 : 3 Credits
        -> Below 60 : 0 Credits

    -> Give Award based on total credits 

        -> Credits: 10 ===> "GOLD" 
        -> Credits: 8-9 ===> "SILVER" 
        -> Credits: Below 8 ===> "BRONZE" 
    
    -> Now Add Course Fee Calculation 

        -> Take Corse Fee as 30000
        -> Apply COUPON functionality 
            -> PROMO apply 5000 Discount 
            -> FIFTY apply 15000 Discount (50% Discount)
        -> Display Actual Fee
        -> Display Discount Amount 
        -> Display Final Fee To Pay 

    -> Change 

        -> Let's add static data, static blocks and static methods 
            using institute details and global discount Calculations 
    

-> Trainer Entity 

    -> ID 
    -> Name 
    -> Ask for Number Of Sessions Taken By Trainer
    -> Collect Above Data From Trainer 

    -> Calculate Payments (per session 1500) based on Number Of Sessions Taken By Trainer

    -> Also prompt the student with asking to rate the trainer (1 to 5) 

    -> Based On Rating if Rating is 5 give 5000 bonus to trainer 

    -> Calculate Total Payment To be made for trainer 

-> Constructor Based Requirements 

    -> studentID
    -> studentName
    -> studentMobileNumber
    -> studentAge 
    -> studentEmail  

-> Showcase Basic Info which is like hover the mouse 

-> Showcase Complete Info which is like click the mouse (like click profile button)

-> NEW CHANGE

    -> LMS Application New Requirements to implement Abstraction

        -> Interfaces (Personable.java, Payables.java)

            -> Personable defines a contract for entities (like Student and Trainer)

                -> managing their personal information

            -> Payables defines a contract for entities that are involved in payment calculations

                -> course fees for students, session payments for trainers

        -> Abstract Class 

            -> AbstractPerson serves as a base class to hold common attributes 
            (like personID, personName, personAge, personMobileNumber)

        -> Concrete Classes (Student.java, Trainer.java)

            -> Student and Trainer classes now extend the AbstractPerson class, inheriting the 
                common personal attributes and their management.
